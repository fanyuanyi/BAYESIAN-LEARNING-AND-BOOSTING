# BAYESIAN-LEARNING-AND-BOOSTING
This is a small project which helps students have a better understanding of Bayesian learning.
This project compares decision trees, naive bayesian and boosting learning.
I completed this code, cooperating with Moein Sorkhei. I would like to show my gratitude to him.
